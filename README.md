That was my Bachelor work. 

The idea was: the application allows to send a message to the selected user that the recipient can receive and read only when physically be in a chosen place with a certain radius. When a user encounters a message addressed for them, their phone will receive a notification from the application.

Server side was hosted on azure and used serverless acrchicture.

Project was not completed fully and limited fuctuanality implemented only on Xamarin.Android, but the main fuctuanality is working.
